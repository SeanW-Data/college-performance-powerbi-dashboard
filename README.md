<h3>📌 Project Overview</h3>

This project presents an end-to-end data analytics and Power BI reporting solution for analysing student success at a fictional institution, Robin’s Rise College.

The dashboard is designed to support academic leadership and operational decision-making by providing visibility into student performance, attendance, withdrawals, and completions. It follows a structured data storytelling approach, progressing from a high-level overview to diagnostic analysis and actionable recommendations.


🎯 Project Objectives

Provide an executive-level snapshot of student success and outcomes

Identify trends and changes in performance and attendance over time

Understand drivers behind withdrawals and completions

Highlight risk areas and stable performers

Demonstrate practical skills in Power BI, DAX, data modelling, and data storytelling


❓ Business Questions Answered

How is the college performing overall in terms of pass rates and completion?

Are student outcomes improving or declining year-on-year?

What relationship exists between attendance and academic success?

Which courses or departments are driving success, and which present risk?

Where should leadership focus intervention efforts to improve retention?

How can data be used to identify early warning signs of withdrawal?

🔍 Key Insights Discovered
Success Drivers

Pass rate increased by 2.4% from 2024 to 2025, indicating encouraging progress in academic outcomes.

Attendance rose modestly year-on-year, supporting improvements in pass rates and reinforcing attendance as a success driver.

Overall, student numbers remain significant, providing stability despite mixed performance trends.

Certain subjects maintained steady attendance, highlighting pockets of strength and effective course delivery.

Risks & Areas of Concern

Average test scores declined compared to 2024, suggesting potential gaps in assessment readiness or knowledge retention.

Completion rates fell while withdrawal rates increased, highlighting rising attrition and potential funding risk.

The Data Analytics course dropped from the highest to the lowest pass rate, driven by reduced attendance despite a slight overall attendance increase.

Attendance challenges persist across multiple courses, negatively impacting both performance and completion outcomes.

📌 Recommendations

To address the mixed performance trends, focus should be placed on strengthening attendance and student engagement, particularly within the Data Analytics course, where reduced participation has directly contributed to declining pass rates.

At the same time, targeted retention strategies are required to reduce withdrawals and stabilise student numbers. This may include early-intervention support for low-attendance students, improved engagement tracking, and course-level reviews where declines are most pronounced.

Ongoing monitoring of pass rates, test scores, attendance, and completion rates will help identify early warning signs. Directing resources toward courses with sharper declines while reinforcing approaches used by stable, high-performing subjects will support a balanced and data-driven response to improving student success.
